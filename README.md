# TheHungryHabitat

Welcome to little silly project for my ECGI 211 - Advanced Computer Programming Course

## What is this?

This project is a game where you play as a cashier. You have to keep track of the stock, sales and change the money back to the customer if they overpaid. Luckily, the shop is next to a bank, so you can always change the coins and notes if you need to.
