# TheHungryHabitat

Welcome to little silly project for my ECGI 211 - Advanced Computer Programming Course

## What is this?

This project is a game where you play as a cashier. You have to keep track of the sales and change the money back to the customer if they overpaid or reject the order if they don't have enough money. Luckily, the shop is next to a bank, so you can always change the coins and notes to any amount if you need to.
