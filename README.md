# TheHungryHabitat

Welcome to little silly project for my ECGI 211 - Advanced Computer Programming Course

## What is this?

This project is a game where you play as a cashier. You have to change the money back to the customer if they overpaid, or reject the order if they don't have enough money. Luckily, the shop is next to a bank, so you can always change the coins and notes to any amount if you need to.

## Limitations

Because the game sound system was developed based on Windows library, this program is not directly portable to other platforms

## How to play?

The flow of the game will be as follow

1. Look at the queue, see who's in front and their amount of money.
2. Look into their receipt, sum up the total they need to pay.
3. Decide how much should you give them change or tell them how much money they are missing.

## Rules

- No calculator, this is a pre-algebra practice.
- You will lose when
  - There are more then 10 customers waiting in queue.
  - You choose incorrectly whether to give them change or tell them to get more money.
  - You give them wrong change.
  - You told them to get wrong amount of money.

### Hope you will have some fun with this game!
