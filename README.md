# TheHungryHabitat

Welcome to little silly project for my ECGI 211 - Advanced Computer Programming Course

## What is this?

This project is a game where you play as a cashier. You have to change the money back to the customer if they overpaid, or reject the order if they don't have enough money. Luckily, the shop is next to a bank, so you can always change the coins and notes to any amount if you need to.

## Limitations

Because the game sound system was developed based on Windows library, this program is not directly portable to other platforms
